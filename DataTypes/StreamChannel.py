    Description:
        An instance of this class is used for streaming 
        measurement data from the Lynx to the client application.
        The history of the Lynx communications is as follows:
            1. Release 1.0 of the Lynx requires the client side to
               send a command to the Lynx requesting measurement data.
               The Lynx responds with the requested data.  
            2. Release 1.1 which contains streaming does not require
               the client side to send a command to the Lynx requesting
               measurement data.  The Lynx always sends measurement data 
               as soon as it is received from the hardware.  This improves
               performance.
        An instance of this class is used to receive data that is sent by
        the Lynx.
